A project that combines an ESP32 and a bunch of wireless modules into something (kinda) useful

So here is the list of components:
1. ESP32 Devkit-C 38Pin
2. NRF24L01 2.4GHz wireless module
3. An ST7789 TFT display
4. CC1101 433MHz wireless module
5. Some 3.7V battery with charging board (optional)
6. Bunch of basic electronic components (to be updated)

All of the schematics and instructions will be added later
